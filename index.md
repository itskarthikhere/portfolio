According to the CDC motor vehicle safety division, one in five car accidents is caused by a distracted driver. Sadly, this translates to 425,000 people injured and 3,000 people killed by distracted driving every year.

In Order to reduce it this ,i have developed a machine learning model that as been traied with multiple classes of actions performed by a driver.if the driver is found to do any other action other that safe driving an alert will be triggered.
